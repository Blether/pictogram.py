readme for pictogram.py

This is an attempt to make a little python program to produce pictograms, sometimes known as iconarrays, to aid treatment choices in shared decision making.

Goals are to have a desktop version, but also have it work within pythonista on iOS


There are simpler ways to get iconarrays of course - for example, freely available from http://www.iconarray.com/
